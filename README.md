# ElectronDeuteronCrossSectionCalc

This program calculates the unpolarized cross-section of electron deuteron scattering. The formula used to calculate the cross section is
in the CrossSectionFormula.png file. Note that this equation needs to be integrated over the momentum of the interacting nucleon
in the deuteron.
